##### TODO
- cron.php inside the vm
- fix 'host' /etc/hosts entry on ec2 boxes
- dns map for ec2 sandboxes?
- checkout iAppsUtlitityScripts, link cache/dibs to usr/local/bin
- export CDPATH
- install jsmin
    pecl install jsmin
    make sure etc/php.d/jsmin.ini is created (use recipe)
- Figure out how to run the iapps-setup::post recipe by the end-user with a config.yaml for things like DB host, etc.
